Modelica Calibration
======

### Goals
This repository is used for the development of Python tools to handle Modelica
models. 

### Recent tasks
The recent tasks concern the proof-of-concept regarding the two areas calibration
and testing. The calibration functions can be used for calibrating compression chillers. 
The testing functions can be used for testing the controller of the FVU in AixLib and a 
real Belimo PLC via BACnet.

### Relations
The project is related to the activities in the calibration of Modelica models and the 
testing of PLCs and control strategies.

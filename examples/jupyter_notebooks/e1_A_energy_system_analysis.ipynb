Before using AixCaliBuHA, you should understand\n what happens in your system. If you have questions regarding modeling assumptions,\n ask e.g. the model developers of the library you are using,\n in this case the AixLib.\n\n Start by setting up the Dymola-API.

That's obviously\n none-sense, but better visualises the influence of the outdoor air temperature\n on the room temperature (third plot).\n The second plot shows how the heat pump is turned on four times,\n resulting in an increase in room temperature. As soon as the hysteresis limit\n of 22 째C room temperature is reached, the heat pump is turned of again.\n Only at initialization this limit exceeds, as the minimal run time of the\n heat pump is enabled as a safety control.\n ### What does this mean for our calibration?\n This means we've understood the basic physics behind our system.\n In this example, we've changed the following four parameters:\n - Volume of room (vol.V = 56 m쨀)\n - Thermal conductance to the ambient / wall insulation (theCon.G = 356 W/K)\n - Heat capacity of walls in the room (heaCap.C = 90000 J/K)\n - Exponent of radiator heat transfer (rad.n = 1.7)\n If any meaning of said parameters is unclear, look up the models used in\n this example. As a take-away note: We focus on the building and heat transfer physics,\n less on the heat pump or HVAC components.\n"

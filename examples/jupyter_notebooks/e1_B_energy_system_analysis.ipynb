Before using AixCaliBuHA, you should understand\n what happens in your system. If you have questions regarding modeling assumptions,\n ask e.g. the model developers of the library you are using,\n in this case the Modelica Standard Library.\n\n Start by setting up the FMU-API. For more info, see the examples in ebcpy.\n As we will use the API in each example, we've created a util function\n under examples\\__init__.py\n"

Both rise until 1 s\n and after 1 s converge against a static value.\n ### Why do we see this?\n To answer this, you have to understand the model.\n The model heat ups the heat capacity with a constant heat flow\n of 10 W.\n This capacity is connected to a pipe with a fixed resistance.\n A fluid is passing through this pipe with a cooler temperature than\n the capacity. Hence, heat moves from the capacity to the pipe depending\n mostly on the mass flow rate of the fluid. The latter depends on two\n things: The speed of the pump and the opening of the valve.\n We influence both values via our tuner parameters we've defined above.\n ### What does this mean for our calibration?\n Both parameters influence the ramp input of the pump and the valve.\n A large duration for the ramps means less speed and opening and\n thus less flow rate leading to warmer pipe and capacity temperatures\n Small values indicate the opposite.\n"

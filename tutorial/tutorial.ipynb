    "*Before going any further, please note that you first should read the tutorial on `ebcpy` ([Link](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/EBC/EBC_all/Python/ebcpy)). The basic data types are explained there. Also, an example for the simulation API is made hinting on AixCaliBuHa and why you may need it.*\n",

    "### What is AixCaliBuHA?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Aix** (from French Aix-la-Chapelle) **Cali**bration for **Bu**ilding and **H**V**A**C Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "This framework attempts to make the process of calibrating models used in building\n",
    "and HVAC systems easier. Different sub packages help with the underlying tasks of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Performing a **Sensitivity Analysis** to discover tuner parameters for the calibration\n",
    "- **Calibration** of given model based on the tuner parameters, the calibration classes and specified goals to evaluate the objective function of the underlying optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Calibration\n",
    "\n",
    "When modelling Building and HVAC-Systems, one wants to make valid statements about the real system. A model which represents some real-world process in a sufficient manner (e.g. in terms of supply temperature) may be useful to makes such statements. Model parameters have to be tuned so that some simulation output matches the output in the real world (e.g. some measurement). \n",
    "- **Which parameters to tune?** You as a modeler may already know important parameters that influence your model regarding a targeted output. However, performing a **sensitivity analysis** may be helpful to quantify which parameters are important.\n",
    "- **How to tune?** Manual tuning is most often still state of the art. However it is very inefficient. Therefore, the appraoch in this framework is the combination of mathematical **optimization** for calcuation of the next **tuner parameter** value and Simulation APIs for **automation of the optimization**.\n",

    "Partly introduced in `ebcpy`, we will briefly explain the underlying `data_types`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tuner Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "All model parameters used either in a Sensitivity Analysis, an Optimization or a Calibration are at some point tuned, thus are tuner paramteres.\n",
    "Basically, a tuner parameter has a name (string), an initial value and minimal/maximal values (floats). For efficient optimization, the values are internally normalized to the range 0..1 (if min/max values (bounds) are given. This way different units (e.g. Temperature / K and Pressure / Pa) behave the same during optimization. Some solvers require boundaries some not. Initial values are not required for some global or stochastic solvers. "

    "`set_sim_target_data` is called in every iteration, therefore the conversion would take place every iteration. Iteration here means that during the subsequent calibration process the simulation is called multiple times and this always calls afterwards the `set_sim_target_data` function. Thus, processing the `std` with the default `float`-based index saves the operation of converting the index type. In contrast, `mtd` index needs to be converted only once! To display your result in the end you may use the original index again, but for the calibration, the index of `std` is used. For the conversion, we offer a preprocessing function in `ebcpy`:"

If it is turned off, the temperature losses may become important and, thus, parameters like heat conductivity should represent a tuner parameter.  \n",

    "## Sensitivity analysis: Get to know your model parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we've mostly talked about calibration. An important step towards a succesful calibration is a sensititity analysis. Be it using our tool or using other applications (Dymola offers some options - see sweep parameters), you have to know which model parameters affect which output value of your model. Not only for calibration, but also for later application of the model for studies this is vital.\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't go into much detail about the theory behind a sensitivity analysis. Taken from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_analysis):\n",
    "> \"Sensitivity analysis is the study of how the uncertainty in the output of a mathematical model or system (numerical or otherwise) can be divided and allocated to different sources of uncertainty in its inputs\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### What do we need to perform a sensitivity analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the definition, we will need a **model**, **output values** and **input values**.\n",
    "The model is provided using the `simulation_api` of `ebcpy`. Output values are in our case our `goals`, because these outputs are relevant for our calibration. Input values are the tuner parameters (`tuner_paras`), as we want to know the uncertainty of each parameter on our goals.  \n",
    "Additionally, we need to specify which analysis we want to perform. We provide an increasing set of methods, look at the docstrings to know which methods are supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more on the methods, check: [morris](https://salib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#method-of-morris) and/or [sobol](https://salib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#sobol-sensitivity-analysis)\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do we implement it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Adapted from the file `sen_analysis_example.py` in the examples folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** To limit the execution time of this code, we use `num_samples=2`. The results are obviously bad, but this is just the tutorial to get you familiar with syntax and output format etc. "

    "The simplest type of calibration in Modelica is the single-class calibration. The `Calibrator` class of `aixcalibuha` inherites from the `Optimizer` class in `ebcpy`. This is due to the fact that a calibration is an optimization. \n",
    "\n",
    "At this point you should already know the things you need for a calibration: `tuner_parameters`, `goals` and at least one `CalibrationClass`. Furthermore, a model is necessary (hence `simulation_api`), and a `statistical_measure` to evaluate the difference between measured and simulated data. Further keyword arguments (`kwargs`) may help with a successful calibration. The next section (Advanced calibration) goes into more detail on that. Read the docstring of the classes to learn more about avaiable options. If you have questions, as always, please raise an issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code is based on the example file: `aixcalibuha\\examples\\calibration_example.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** To limit the execution time of this code, we use the solver/method/framework-specific kwargs `maxiter=0` and `popsize=1`. This limits the number of simulations drastically (to around 9 in the present case). The results are obviously bad, but this is just the tutorial to get you familiar with syntax and output format etc. "

    "\n",
    "When performing an optimization, one should know the [**no free lunch theorem**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_free_lunch_in_search_and_optimization). Therefore, we cannot tell you which solver is the best and which settings to choose. However, as we are limited to Building Energy Systems, the following best practices may be a good starting point for you. They are purely based on experience in calibration and are neither empirically grounded or mathematically proven. Nevertheless, here we go:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Contribute to this list**: If you learn/know something useful about calibration which should be in this list, add it!\n",
    "- **Contribute to AixCaliBuHA**: A lot of people have the same problems you have/had. Although it consumes more time than writing a quick&dirty script on your own: Help to expand and improve this framework by contributing. Not only others will thank you in the future.\n",
    "- **Use gradient-free solvers for Modelica**: Calibrating a simulation model is a black box for the solver. Therefore, gradient-free methods (`dlib_minimize`, `scipy_differential_evolution`) yield better results than most methods of e.g. `scipy_minimize`. The latter require the gradient of a function.\n",
    "- **Check your initial values**: Using `AixCaliBuHA`, we provide visualization to help you identify possible points of improvment. One is the initialization. If the difference is big, you may either use `timedelta` for a steady-state intial condition OR use explicit start values which you write in the Modelica model. You may alter these start values through the `dymola_api`.\n",
    "- **Test different solver (and options)**: This is maybe time consuming. But try out different options and see what works best for you. If you read about a solver which works well for you, raise an isse: We can include it into the framework pretty fast.\n",
    "- **Pre-process your data**: Noisy input data will most certaintly yield bad results.\n",
    "- **Never ever copy results blindly**: The two points below further explain why. We are engineers and should always question the solution the calibration/simulation yields.\n",
    "- **Don't overfit**: Especially using stocahstical methods, you will find (after 1000 of iterations) pretty good paramteres. However keep in mind that these parameters also have to be validated\n",
    "- **Question unphysical parameteres**: You modelled a physical system but some tuned parameter makes no sense? Boundaries might have been set to broad. Check if the model or the measurement is physically coherent. If not, adapt it."
